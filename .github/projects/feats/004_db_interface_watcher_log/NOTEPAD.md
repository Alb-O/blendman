# NOTEPAD.md â€” Feature 004_db_interface_watcher_log

## Task Log (2025-07-09)

- [x] Read and summarized all referenced documentation and READMEs for integration patterns and event/data models.
- [x] Created/extended `src/blendman/` with: `models.py`, `db_interface.py`, `watcher_bridge.py`, and `__init__.py`.
- [x] Implemented DB models for files, directories, and rename logs, with parent/child relationships and indexes.
- [x] Implemented watcher bridge to subscribe to watcher events and transform them into DB operations.
- [x] Implemented main interface logic to expose APIs for querying logs, file/dir state, and history.
- [x] Added robust error handling and logging throughout all modules.
- [x] Added `.env.example` for new environment variables and ensured `load_env()` is used.
- [x] Wrote Pytest unit tests for all new logic (expected, edge, failure cases).
- [x] Updated the main `README.md` with setup/integration notes.
- [x] Ran `./dev.ps1` to validate with `ruff`, `mypy`, and `pytest`. All blendman validation gates passed.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Final review: re-read PRD, ensure all requirements and validation gates are met.

All implementation and validation steps for this feature are complete except for the final review.
