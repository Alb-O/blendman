**Last updated:** 2025-07-09 (finalized)

## Progress Summary
- PRD re-reviewed and requirements extracted.
- Modular test suite created: property-based, fuzz, edge-case, and platform-specific test files scaffolded.
- Shared utils for random file trees, edge-case names, and concurrency implemented.
- Property-based and fuzz tests implemented and passing.
- All validation gates (tests, lint, type checks) pass.


## Final Status
- [x] Implement explicit edge-case tests (test_edge_cases.py)
- [x] Implement platform-specific tests (test_platforms.py)
- [x] Add code coverage measurement and minimal failing case logging
- [x] Update documentation and compatibility matrix
- [x] Final PRD checklist review and mark complete


## All PRD TODOs: COMPLETE
- [x] Edge-case tests: path length, unicode, symlinks, permissions, etc.
- [x] Platform-specific event API tests (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- [x] Coverage and minimal-case logging for property/fuzz tests
- [x] Documentation: update README and compatibility matrix
- [x] Mark all tasks complete in NOTEPAD.md
